The Intellij IDEA plugin for Stellaris modding (also supports other Paradox Interactive games), which is smart, convenient and with more potential.

Features:

* Supports script & localisation languages and CWT language (used by config files).
* Provides various almost excellent language features for script & localisation languages, including code highlight, code navigation, code completion, code inspection, code refactoring, quick documentation, inlay hints, live templates, code hierarchy, diagram, diff and more.
* Provides basic language features for CWT language, including code highlight, code navigation, quick documentation and more.
* Supports previewing and rendering DDS and TGA pictures, and provides actions to convert image formats (PNG, DDS, TGA).
* Supports rendering scope context, localisation text, images and other useful information via quick documentation and inlay hints.
* Supports most advanced features of script & localisation languages (such as parameters, scopes, inline scripts and various complex expressions).
* Supports customizing extended config files, allowing plugin to provide more perfect language features (such as code navigation, code completion, quick documentation and inlay hints).
* Automatically recognizes game directories and mod directories.

This plugin has implemented various advanced language features based on [config groups](config.md#config-group), which consists of CWT config files.
The latest-version config files are already built into this plugin, make it works right out of the box.
Besides, [customizing](config.md#writing-cwt-config-files) and [importing](config.md#importing-cwt-config-files) local config files are also supported.

If [Translation](https://github.com/YiiGuxing/TranslationPlugin) is also installed, this plugin can provide some [additional features](plugin-integration.md).

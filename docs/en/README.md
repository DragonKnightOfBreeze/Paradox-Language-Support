IDEA plugin: Support for Paradox language.

Features:

* Supports script & localization languages and CWT language (used as config files).
* Provides various almost excellent language features for script & localisation languages, including code highlight, code navigation, code completion, code inspection, code refactoring, quick documentation, inlay hints, live templates, code hierarchy, diagram, diff and more.
* Provides basic language features for CWT language, including code highlight, code navigation, quick documentation and more.
* Supports rendering scope context, localisation text, DDS images and other useful information via quick documentation and inlay hints.
* Supports most advanced features of script & localisation languages (such as parameters, scopes, inline scripts and various complex expressions).
* Supports customizing extended config files, allowing plugin to provide more perfect language features (such as code navigation, code completion, quick documentation and inlay hints).
* Automatically recognizes the game directory (containing the launcher settings file `launcher-settings.json`) and mod directory (containing the mod descriptor file `descriptor.mod`).

This plugin has implemented various advanced language features based on [CWT config groups](https://windea.icu/Paradox-Language-Support/#/en/config.md#cwt-config-group), which consists of CWT config files.
The latest-version config files are already built into this plugin, make it works right out of the box.
Besides, [customizing](https://windea.icu/Paradox-Language-Support/#/en/config.md#writing-cwt-config-files) and [importing](https://windea.icu/Paradox-Language-Support/#/en/config.md#importing-cwt-config-files) local config files are also supported.

If [Translation](https://github.com/YiiGuxing/TranslationPlugin) is also installed, this plugin can provide some [additional features](https://windea.icu/Paradox-Language-Support/#/zh/plugin-integration.md).

If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to provide feedback via GitHub or Discord.

# CWTools config rules for Stellaris
.cwt config files for Stellaris

These will be used automatically, using the latest tag for `stable` and the latest commit for `latest`.
To manually use for testing or contributing, copy the contents of the config folder and place it in a folder called `.cwtools` in the folder you open in vscode.

See https://github.com/tboby/cwtools/wiki/.cwt-config-file-guidance for guidance on the file format

### Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, press the pen icon on any file, then press "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". You can then make further changes as a "pull request". When done, mention it in the pull request and your changes will be included.

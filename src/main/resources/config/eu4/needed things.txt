-A type within a type.
-Province IDs: There seem to be multiple places I can read them from, but the source is a .csv file.
-Dates as a valid entry
-Only =, not < >
-Greater importance of case sensitivity (in localisation at least i.e. it must be "Root", "From")
-The same trigger doing different things in country/province scope
-Trade_node scope (takes all rules from province but there are a couple of things that only work with it)
-variable:new_ruler_culture (you can export cultures to a variable)
-key_filter = enum[stuff] (if easy to add)

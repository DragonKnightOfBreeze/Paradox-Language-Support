# .cwt config file guidance

[.cwt config file guidance Â· cwtools/cwtools Wiki](https://github.com/cwtools/cwtools/wiki/.cwt-config-file-guidance)

`.cwt` files are used by cwtools to perform validation as well as provide completion and documentation. The basic format is very similar to pdxscript, with a few minor additions.

To use custom `.cwt` files place them in a folder called `.cwtools` in the folder you open in vscode (The root of your mod folder).

## Basic structure

The following config shows an example of a partial definition for Stellaris's ship_size.

```
ship_size = {
    ## cardinality = 0..1    
    ### The base cost of this ship_size
    cost = int

    modifier = {
        alias_name[modifier] = alias_match_left[modifier]
    }

    ## cardinality = 0..1    
    acceleration = float

    construction_type = scalar

    ## cardinality = 0..1
    default_behavior = <ship_behavior>

    ## cardinality = 0..1
    prerequisites = {
        ## cardinality = 0..100
        <technology>
    }

    ## cardinality = 0..1
    upkeep_override = {
        energy = int
        minerals = int
    }

    class = enum[shipsize_class]    
}
```

This says that ship_size:

- May contain between 0 and 1 fields named `cost` with an `int` value. It also has a description of `The base cost of this ship_size`.
- Must contain a `modifier` clause, which can contain many `modifier`s (see aliases below)
- May contain between 0 and 1 fields named `acceleration` with a `float` value.
- Must contain a field named `construction_type` with a `scalar` value (any string).
- May contain between 0 and 1 fields named `ship_behavior` with a value that is the name of a `ship_behavior` type (see types below).
- May contain a `prerequisite` clause, which may contain between 0 and 100 values that are names of `technology` types (see types below).
- May contain a `upkeep_override` clause, which must contain an `energy` `int` value and a `mineral` `int` value.
- Must contain a `class` field, which a value that is in the `shipsize_class` enum (see enums below)


### Simple rules

Simple rules check the right hand value against several common datatypes. These are:

- `bool`: `is_triggered_only = bool` would match `is_triggered_only = yes` and `is_triggered_only = no`
- `int`: `count = int` would match any integer. Int can have a range specified with `int[-5..100]` limiting it to -5 to 100. Also accepts `int[-inf..inf]`.
- `float`: `acceleration = float` would match any float. Float can have a ranged specified with `float[-5.0..100.0]` limiting it to -5 to 100. Also accepts `float[-inf..inf]`.
- `scalar`: matches any string
- `percentage_field` matches a value ending with `%`
- `localisation`: matches a localisation key, or a quoted sentence
- `localisation_synced`: matches a localisation_synced key, or a quoted sentence
- `localisation_inline`: matches either a localisation key, or a quoted inline localisation string (rejects quoted keys)
- `filepath` : matches a string if the file referenced in the string exists
- `filepath[some/path/]`: matches a string if the file referenced in the string exists, with the given prefix ("some/path/" + string should be a file)
- `filepath[some/path/,.ext]`: matches a string if the file referenced in the string exists, with the given prefix and given extension ("some/path/ + string + ".ext" should be a file)
- `icon[gfx/interface/ships]`: matches "gfx/interface/ships/x.dds" for a given string x.
- `date_field` : matches an EU4 style date field (YYYY.MM.DD)
- `<type_key>`: `modifier = <opinion_modifier>` will match the names of any opinion_modifier found by the `type[opinion_modifier]` rule
- `prefix_<type_key>_suffix`: `modifier = pre_<opinion_modifier>_suf` will match the names of any opinion_modifier found by the `type[opinion_modifier]` rule, with the optional prefix and/or suffix added.
- `enum[enum_key]`: `set_fleet_stance = enum[fleet_stance]` will match any values in the `enum[fleet_stance]` rule
- `scope[scope_key]`: `who = scope[country]` will match any target that has a scope of country. `event_target[country]` is equivalent to this.
- `scope_field`: `scope_field = scalar` will match any target (This form exists to avoid a conflict with `scope = `in vanilla.
- `variable_field`: matches a number or a reference to a variable. Accepts `variable_field[min..max]` to limit the range of numbers.
- `int_variable_field`: same as `variable_field`, but restricted to integers.
- `value_field`: matches a number or other reference to a value (in Jomini games). Accepts `value_field[min..max]` to limit the range of numbers.
- `int_value_field`: same as `value_field`, but restricted to integers.
- `alias_keys_field[trigger]`: matches a string that is a key in a rule alias (this is mainly used for `switch`


### Enums

Enums are groups of values that can be used as possible values elsewhere. They are defined as:

```
enums = {
    enum[shipsize_class] = {
        shipclass_military
        shipclass_military_station
        shipclass_transport
        shipclass_starbase
        shipclass_constructor
        shipclass_colonizer
    }
}
```

Given this enum and the rule `class = enum[shipsize_class]`, any of the following would be valid: `class = shipclass_military`, `class = shipclass_military_station`, etc.

#### Complex enum

If you need to generate an enum dynamically from mod files, you can use a `complex_enum`.

```
	complex_enum[event_chain_counter] = {
		path = "game/common/event_chains"
		name = {
			counter = {
				enum_name = {

				}
			}
                        scalar = {
                                scalar = enum_name
                        }
		}
	}
```

`path` is the folder in which files are processed for this enum. `name` contains a structure that will be mapped onto each top level entity in the files given. The structure will be followed until a key is found in the place of `enum_name`. This key will then be added to the enum. `scalar` will match anything, otherwise the key needs to match. `start_from_root` makes the complex enum start from the top of the file instead of from the first level.

### Value sets

Sometimes game entities aren't defined explicitly by types, but simply by usage. Value sets are configured by a pair of rules `value_set[key]` and `value[key]`, for example:

```
set_country_flag = value_set[country_flag]
has_country_flag = value[country_flag]
```

The rule `value[key]` will accept any value that has been used in a matching `value_set[key]`. Completion will also be provided for these values.


### Types

Types are the top level entities that are used to connect files to config rules. This roughly lines up with folders, and examples are things like "ship_size", "army" or "event" in Stellaris.

```
types = {
    type[technology] = {
        path = "game/common/technology"
    }
    type[ship_behavior] = {
        name_field = "name"
        path = "game/common/ship_behaviors"
    }
}
```

A simple type is just a type name and a path to the folder that type's files are found. By default, the top-level key is used as the name, and the starting point for any validation. The validation for a type is specified in the top-level rule with the name of the type. However, if a different field needs to be used then `name_field` lets you specify where to get the name from.

- `skip_root_key`: `skip_root_key = tech_group` will skip the top-level key `tech_group` and look for types at the second level, underneath `tech_group`. `skip_root_key = any` will skip any top-level key, finding the type at every second level key in matching files. `skip_root_key != tech_group` will skip any top-level key except `tech_group`
- `skip_root_key = { something any else }`: skips several levels. So this would skip `something = { blah = { else = {`.
- `skip_root_key = tech` `skip_root_key = tech_group`: Multiple entries will skip (or not skip) each of the options
- `path_strict`: `path_strict = yes` will require the file's directory to match `path` entirely (excluding subfolders)
- `path_file`: `path_file = test.txt` will only match the given filename
- `path_extension`: `path_extension = .txt` will only match files with the given extension
- `## type_key_filter` : `## type_key_filter = country_event` would require all entries for this type to have the key `country_event`. `type_key_filter <> country_event` would require all entries to have any other key. This can also take a list of values like `## type_key_filter = { one two three }`
- `type_per_file`: if `yes`, starts types from the root of a file instead of all the top level blocks
- `starts_with`: `starts_with = b_` will only match blocks that start with `b_` (e.g. for CK2 titles)
- `severity`: `severity = warning` will reduce the errors in this type to warnings
- `unique`: `unique = yes` will show errors if the same type name is defined multiple times
- `## graph_related_types = { special_project anomaly_category }`: This comment option enables the graph view for this type, and will include the listed types in the graph


### Subtypes

Some types have multiple mutually exclusive versions with different validation requirements. The following is an example of `ship_size` having two possible subtypes, `starbase` and `military`. The subtype clause is a set of rules used to determine which subtype a type is. They are tested in order, and if none match then there is no subtype

```
types = {
    type[ship_size] = {
        path = "game/common/ship_sizes"
        subtype[starbase] = {
            class = shipclass_starbase
        }
        subtype[platform] = {
            class = shipclass_military_station
        }
        subtype[ship] = {

        }
    }
}
```

This can then be used in the main rules to add extra rules. In the following example, only the `starbase` subtype rules will apply.

```
ship_size = {
    class = shipclass_starbase

    section_slots = {
        subtype[starbase] = {

        }
        subtype[ship] = {
            "bow" = {
                locator = scalar 
            }
            "mid" = {
                locator = scalar 
            }
            "stern" = {
                locator = scalar 
            }
        }
        subtype[platform] = {
            "west" = {
                locator = scalar 
            }
            "east" = {
                locator = scalar 
            }
        }
    }

    subtype[starbase]  = {
        flip_control_on_disable = bool
    }
    subtype[ship] = {
        combat_disengage_chance = float
    }
    
}
```

Subtype can also take a number of options:

- `## type_key_filter = country_event`: Subtypes can take a single type_key_filter
- `## push_scope = country`: If this subtype is valid, this scope is set when validating the type
- `## starts_with = b_`: If the type key starts with this, it will have this subtype
- `## display_name = "Fancy name"`: The pretty name for the subtype
- `## abbreviation = ST`: The short form for this subtype in graph displays


### Localisation

Types can also be used to define localisation that must be provided for each entry of that type. By default these are only checked when a type is referenced (as an unused type doesn't need localisation). However, the `## required` option can be used to mark validation as mandatory.

Localisation requirements are defined in the format `friendly_name = "prefix_$_suffix"`. The dollar will be replaced with the actual name of the type. `## primary` marks the localisation as the most significant text for this type

```
type[ship_size] = {
    path = "game/common/ship_sizes"
    localisation = {
        name = "$"
        description = "$_desc"
        ## required
        required = "$_required"
        subtype[advanced] = {
            advanced = "$_advanced"
        }
    }
    subtype[advanced] = {
        is_advanced = yes
    }
}
```

If the above type definition is combined with the rule `for_ship = <ship_size>`, `for_ship = my_ship` would require the following localisation to be defined:

```
my_shipmy_ship_descmy_ship_required
```

If `my_ship_mk_2` has subtype `advanced`, it would require:

```
my_ship_mk_2
my_ship_mk_2_desc
my_ship_mk_2_required
my_ship_mk_2_advanced
```


### Aliases

Aliases allow the grouping of rules for reuse across many rules. The obvious example for this is effects. A simple event rule definition like the following allows any number of `effect` alias rules inside the immediate clause.

```
event = {    ## cardinality = 0..1    immediate = {        alias_name[effect] = alias_match_left[effect]    }}
```

And an alias could be defined like:

```
alias[effect:create_starbase] = {    ## cardinality = 1..1    owner = scalar    ## cardinality = 1..1    size = scalar    ## cardinality = 0..100    module = scalar    ## cardinality = 0..100    building = scalar    ## cardinality = 0..1    alias_name[effect] = alias_match_left[effect]}
```

or even just

```
alias[effect:THIS] = { alias_name[effect] = alias_match_left[effect] }
```


### Single-alias

A single-alias allows re-use of a section of rules in multiple places. Defined in this way:

```
single_alias[any_trigger_clause] = {   
  ## cardinality = 0..1    
  count = int    
  alias_name[trigger] = alias_match_left[trigger]
}
```

Used in this way:

```
## push_scope = country
any_country = single_alias_right[any_trigger_clause]
```

Which becomes the equivalent of:

```
## push_scope = country
any_country = {    
  ## cardinality = 0..1    
  count = int    
  alias_name[trigger] = alias_match_left[trigger]
}
```


### Options

There are a number of options that can be applied to rules by placing them in a comment above the rule

- `## cardinality = 0..1`: the following rule can be matched between `min..max` times, where min is any integer and max is any integer or `inf` for unlimited.
- `## cardinality = ~1..2`: same as above, but will only be a warning if below the minimum threshold (less strict)
- `## push_scope = country`: the following rule is a context switch/scope change into the specified scope. This adds the scope onto the current scope stack.
- `## replace_scope = { this = planet root = planet from = ship fromfrom = country }`: this following rule replaces the given parts of the current scope context with the given scopes. Any number of `this`,`root`,`from`,`fromfrom`,`fromfromfrom` and `fromfromfromfrom` can be specified.
- `## severity = information`: the following rule has any errors changed to this severity (error/warning/information/hint)
- `## scope = country`: the following rule is only valid when the current scope matches that given. Alternatively `## scope = { country planet }` for multiple valid scopes.


### Comments

Like pdxscript files, the `#` character is used to comment out lines. In `.cwt` files:

- `#` is used for comments: `# This text will be completely ignored`
- `##` is used for options `## cardinality = 0..1`
- `###` is used for documentation `### This text will be displayed in the completion info`


### Special files

In addition to types, enums and validation in .cwt files, there are several "magic" files used for defining core game concepts.

#### Game files (script_docs)

In CK3, Imperator and Stellaris the game generated "script docs" are used where appropriate. For example, `triggers.log` is used to generate the scopes that triggers can be used in.

#### scopes.cwt

This file contains a block called `scopes` which contains entries such as:

```
"Landed title" = {		aliases = { landed_title "landed title" }		data_type_name = "Title"    }
```

Where the LHS key is the display text of the scope, aliases are how they are referenced in rules and script, data_type_name is the link to localisation scopes, and `is_subscope_of = { province }` is used for scopes like EU4's trade node which can be used as another scope in one direction.

#### links.cwt

This file contains a block called `links` which represents 1:1 links used in the `x.y` chains, and contains entries such as:

```
faith = {        desc = " Unknown, add something in code registration"        from_data = yes        type = scope        data_source = <faith>        prefix = faith:        input_scopes = { landed_title province }        output_scope = faith    }
```

Where the LHS is the link keyword when `from_data` is false,

- desc is the documentation string
- input_scopes are the scope it can chain *from*. If absent, it's a global scope link
- output_scope is the scope it results in
- from_data indicates it's a set of links generated from other script files
- data_source is the cwtools data source for valid values
- prefix is the mandatory prefix before each key `faith:christian`
- type is used to indicate if it's a scope or value (`scope`, `both`)

#### folders.cwt

This is a link of folder names that should be scanned for script files in this game.

#### modifiers.cwt/modifier_categories.cwt

This file contains a block `modifiers` that contains a list of `modifier_name = modifier_scope_group`. These are added to the alias `modifier`, and the scopes are taken from the `modifier_categories.cwt` file.

#### values.cwt

This file contains a block `values` that contains multiple lists of hardcoded cwtools `value_set` values. In CK3 and onwards this is taken from the "event targets set from code" or similar list in script docs

#### localisation.cwt

This file contains a block `localisation_commands `that contains a list of localistaion commands and what scope they can be used in. E.g. `GetMotherFather = { monarch heir consort advisor }`. This is only used in pre-jomini games.

    Reports (global) scripted variables that are overridden incorrectly according to their override rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
  <p>
    The vanilla scripted variable is <code>@var</code>, declared in file <code>common/scripted_variables/test.txt</code>,
    and the overridden scripted variable is declared in file <code>common/scripted_variables/zzz_test.txt</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This override is incorrect because the override rule is <b>FIOS</b>.

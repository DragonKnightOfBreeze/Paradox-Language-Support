  Reports incorrect event id declarations in related event declarations.
  <p>
    Event id should be in correct format.
  </p>
  <p>
    In detail,
    the format of an event id should be <code>"{namespace}.{no}"</code>,
    while <code>"{namespace}"</code> is the event namespace (ignore case),
    and <code>"{no}"</code> is a non-negative integer (ignore leading zero).
  </p>
  <!-- tooltip end -->
  <p>
    In an event script file,
    the event id is declared as a property of an event definition (named <code>"id"</code>),
    the event namespace is declared as the root property of the file (named <code>"namespace"</code>) before event definitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    An event script file is a script file with extension ".txt" under directory <code>events</code>.

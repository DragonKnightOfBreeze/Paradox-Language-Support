  Checks that the event id of each event definition declared in an event script file matches the event namespace.
  <p>
    In detail,
    the format of an event id should be <code>"{namespace}.{no}"</code>,
    while <code>"{namespace}"</code> is the event namespace (ignore case),
    and <code>"{no}"</code> is a non-negative integer (ignore leading zero).
  </p>
  <p>
    In an event script file,
    the event id is declared as a property of an event definition, with name <code>"id"</code>,
    the event namespace is declared as the root property of the file before event definitions,
    with name<code>"namespace"</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    An event script file is a script file under directory <code>events</code>
    relative to the game or mod root directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: Support multiple event namespaces in the same event script file.

  Reports localisation files which miss a localisation declaration.
  <p>
    For a localisation file, it's name should contain a locale id,
    and it's containing locale declaration should be only the matched one.
    e.g, the locale declaration <code>l_english</code> in the file <code>events_l_english.yml</code>.

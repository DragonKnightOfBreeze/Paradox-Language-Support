  Reports incorrect overrides of definitions.
  <p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a definition with the same name and type exists in the current context, an override of this definition is considered present.</li>
    <li>Applies only to project script files that are game or mod files, excluding in-memory or injected files.</li>
    <li>Applies only to non-parameterized, non-anonymous definitions declared as script properties.</li>
    <li>Checked based on its override strategy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Override strategies and behaviors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>FIOS</code> (First In, Only Served): Read only once. The first-loaded one takes effect, and subsequent ones will be just ignored.</li>
    <li><code>LIOS</code> (Last In, Only Served): Later reads override. The last loaded overrides the first loaded.</li>
    <li><code>DUPL</code> (Duplicates): Whole-file override. Must be overridden entirely by a file with the same path.</li>
    <li><code>ORDERED</code> (Ordered): Sequential reading. Existing ones cannot be overwritten, and later loaded ones will be sequentially added or merged.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>
    The original definition is named <code>country_event.1</code>, declared in <code>events/country_events.txt</code>,
    and the overriding definition is declared in <code>events/zzz_country_events.txt</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This override is incorrect because events use the <code>FIOS</code> override strategy.

  <p>
    Reports definitions that are overridden incorrectly according to their override rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
  <p>
    The vanilla definition is <code>country_event.1</code>, declared in file <code>events/country_events.txt</code>,
    and the overridden definition is declared in file <code>events/zzz_country_events.txt</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This override is incorrect because the override rule for events is <b>FIOS</b>.

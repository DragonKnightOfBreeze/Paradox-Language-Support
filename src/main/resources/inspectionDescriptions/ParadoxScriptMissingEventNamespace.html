  <!-- tooltip end -->
  <p>
    In an event script file,
    the event namespace is declared as the root property of the file before event definitions,
    while the property's name is <code>"namespace"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An event script file is a script file with extension <code>.txt</code> under directory <code>events</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>  In real, an event script file can declare multiple event namespaces.

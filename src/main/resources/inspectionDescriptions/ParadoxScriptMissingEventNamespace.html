    Reports event script files which miss event namespace declarations.
  </p>
  <!-- tooltip end -->
  <p>
    In an event script file,
    the event namespace is declared as the root property of the file before event definitions,
    while the property's name is <code>"namespace"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An event script file is a script file with extension ".txt"
    under directory <code>events</code> or it's subdirectories.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: An event script file can declare multiple event namespaces.

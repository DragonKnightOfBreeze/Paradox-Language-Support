    Reports mismatched event id declarations in related event declarations.

  <p>
    Event id should match the event namespace declared before it in event script files.
  </p>
  <!-- tooltip end -->
  <p>
    In an event script file,
    the event id is declared as a property of an event definition (named <code>"id"</code>),
    the event namespace is declared as the root property of the file (named <code>"namespace"</code>) before event definitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    An event script file is a script file with extension ".txt" under directory <code>events</code> or it's subdirectories.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>
    In real, event id and event namespace can be matched crossing event script files in game loading order.

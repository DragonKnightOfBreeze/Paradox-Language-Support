# Hopefully someday we will write a full file here.

# For now, note about "cost":
# You can (in both species and leader traits) specify something like
	# cost = {
	# 	base = 1
	# 	modifier = {
	# 		add = 2
	# 		has_country_flag = something #(no way of accessing species scope, it proved highly impractical)
	# 	}
	# }
# If you do this, the "base" will be used in cases where there is no country scope (e.g. customising a species in empire setup, and various
# randomisation functions used mainly during galaxy generation. And a few more places). So you should always set that to a sensible number.

# Some parameters for species traits
#
# assembly_score: evaluated when the game decides to build a species. Default is 0, anything positive adds some extra weight to
# a species with that trait. (Has species and planet scope). A value of 0 does not stop it being picked, it just means this factor won't make
# a difference. If you make it strongly negative, it will not pick this species. You probably only want to be in the range from -2 to 2 or so.
#
# allowed_archetypes = {}
# determines if the trait is valid for the given archetypes.
# accepts BIOLOGICAL, LITHOID, ROBOT and MACHINE by default.
#
# species_class = {}
# determines if the trait is valid for the given species class.
# requires the species class is a member of an allowed archetype
#
# opposites = {}
# opposite traits are mutually exclusive.
#
# species_potential_add = {}
# show the trait to add to species when genemodding or randomizing traits.
# Scopes are this = species, from = country performing the modification.
# default = always=yes

# species_possible_add = {}
# governs if the trait can be added when creating a template with genemodding.
# Scopes are this = species, from = country performing the modification.
# default = always=yes

# species_possible_merge_add = {}
# governs if the trait can be added when applying a template to an existing species with genemodding.
# Scopes are this = species, from = country performing the modification.
# default = always=yes

# species_possible_remove = {}
# allow to remove the trait when genemodding.
# Scopes are this = species, from = country performing the modification.
# default = always=yes

# species_possible_merge_remove = {}
# governs if the trait can be removed when applying a template to an existing species with genemodding.
# Scopes are this = species, from = country performing the modification.
# default = always=yes

# triggered_planet_growth_habitability_modifier = {}
# required for triggered modifiers that use pop_growth_speed, pop_environment_tolerance or such.
# won't show in trait tooltips, use custom_tooltip/custom_tooltip_with_modifiers
# scope is planet, from is species, fromfrom is country

# triggered_pop_modifier = {}
# required for triggered modifiers on the pop scope.
# won't show in trait tooltips, use custom_tooltip/custom_tooltip_with_modifiers
